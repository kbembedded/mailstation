# Mailstation ROM firmware dumps

These folders contain direct codeflash dumps from various firmware revisions of different Mailstation models. Most of these were dumped using `maildump` and `spew`. This process was verified on a few units by directly dumping the contents of the flash chips themselves.

Some firmware will have some specific comments or notes. Anything of real note that is common to all firmware versions are listed below.

## Adding new firmware images

If you have access to a firmware version that is not listed here, nor the means to dump the firmware, please reach out to me as I would like to get a hold of it.
