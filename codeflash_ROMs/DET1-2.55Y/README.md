# Firmware Rev 2.55Y

Desoldered and dumped directly as well as verified against `maildump` and `spew` process

Checksum of ROM in Mailstation diagnostic menu is BA7C

The dataflash file in here was desolderd and dumped directly. There is nothing useful on it really, just here as a reference of what is a valid dataflash image structure.
