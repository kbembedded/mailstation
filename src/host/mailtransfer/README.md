# Mailtransfer
Send / recv files between a Mailstation and host PC

Currently can only send file up to 65535 bytes, only meant to send Dataflash applications at this time.

Can receive any size file, however, this size needs to be known ahead of time by both parties.

Otherwise behaves the same as the original mailsend and maildump from the Yahoo! group.
