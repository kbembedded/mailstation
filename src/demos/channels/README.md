# Channels
The official Mailstation apps were named "channels." These included such things as news headlines, TV channel listings, lotto numbers, weather, and horoscope. A Mailstation account could subscribe to up to 5 different channels (this is why the maximum number of apps is suspected to be 5) that would update when the user connected to exchange email.

These apps were mostly just static images that displayed localized information rather than being something interactive. However, they have hooks in to the Mailstation OS that gives them a "standard" window decoration and the ability to sanely return to the main Mailstation menu. This concept warrants further investigation

Contained in here are a number of channel snapshots that were taking from Mailstation's that had them installed. Originally dumped with tools from the [mailstation-tools project](https://github.com/jcs/mailstation-tools), these have been modified to be buildable again.

These are intended to run as apps, so, starting from `0x4000` as origin.

The tvlisting app is where most of the RE effort and notes are kept to better understand the Mailstation channel interface.
