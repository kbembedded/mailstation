# Drawimage
A demo to showcase drawing images to the screen. A single demo that can be compiled in two different ways (by changing the source code slightly) to put a cityscape image or "Fybertech" logo on the screen.

This uses a function in its own file that was pulled from the Mailstation firmware. It was copied in to its own file for ease of use as a demo.
